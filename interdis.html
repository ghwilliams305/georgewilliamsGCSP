                <h1>FSE 150 Cource Summary</h1>
                <section id="intro">
                    <p>I had many interests starting college: coding, composing, space technology, and engineering. I had plans to advance each of these interests individually, and my goals varied. The biggest impact FSE 150 had on me was that it showed me that I can consolidate my interests into one mission. My theme in GSCP is sustainability particularly in space infrastructure projects such as asteroid mining, spaceport systems that make traditional rocket systems more effective, and colonies to provide a home base. FSE 150 empowered me to think bigger than what I originally thought, and for that, I am grateful for it.</p>

                    <h2>GCSP Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>My first project in GCSP is the portfolio. Calling this project a school assignment would be wildly inaccurate. As I mentioned one of my interests is coding. As of Fall 2023, I am working on becoming a certified web developer, and a project for the class is to create a digital portfolio. I had to force myself off this project. I would come across this portfolio and say to myself: “I can tinker with this.” 4 hours later, I would look up and question where in the world did my day go. All this to say, that this website is one of my favorite projects of this year.

                        <h2>Research Paper</h2>
                        <p>The first major project we were assigned was the research paper. This one was by far the most difficult. It was because it was my first time decoding and interpreting academic papers. An experience that I am incredibly grateful for. I wanted to get my paper done a month before it was due. I planned to get the paper done in about a week, but that week was a fight. Along with my other classwork, I spent the week not sleeping. In the middle of that week, I had to split the time between repairing my computer because the software became completely corrupted. I spent about 72 hours straight working on the research paper and fixing my computer. Eventually, I succeeded. I wrote my research paper on 4 advancements made in space technology. 2 of them involved software programs and metaheuristic algorithms. 2 of them were about more hardware-based technologies. For my societal challenges, I analyzed the challenges that came with the first wave of colonization in the Americas. Still, I enjoyed the project at least when I was not decoding academic papers. It introduced me to the complexities of space travel, and how people plan to overcome them. It showed me how coding in algorithms can also be a way to improve efficiency. This project culminated in a presentation that focused on one of the technologies. I choose to focus on my least favorite one involving using membranes for purification systems. I dreaded the time I would have to stand in front of the class because of my perceived lack of interest in the topic. When I got up in front of the class, I realized how I still consider this topic to be of interest. I enjoy talking about it. I learned how to expand on topics and really how to display my understanding. It was not perfect, but it was a first step.

                        <h2>Future Solutions Project</h2>
                        <img src="./resources/images/ashark_team.jpg" alt="Photo of project team members"/>
                        <p>The last project of FSE 150 was the future solutions project. Originally, we had a wild idea to use gravity-like electricity in a “gravitational current” fashion. The idea was to put spaceships in this current and they would accelerate throughout the solar system. The gravitational field would be manipulated by some device to behave like the electromagnetic field. It was determined to be unplasible because it would require a form of antigravity. The next idea was to make a gravitational laser to do the same thing. It would work by making an intense wave that would shrink the space in front of a spacecraft and expand the space behind the ship. The gravitational waves would be created by a large ring object with two massive objects spinning in a circle on opposite sides of the ring. The idea was the wave inside the ring would cancel each and the wave would extend from the ring. The problem came when figuring out how to focus the waves which we guessed would require a material that acted like a black hole, so we scrapped it. We eventually settled with making an antimatter fusion rocket where the gamma rays from the antimatter would aid with fusion. Liquid helium would move to cool the fusion expanding and thrusting the rocket forward. This was my favorite project in GCSP because I got to work with a wonderful team and entertain the wildest ideas.
