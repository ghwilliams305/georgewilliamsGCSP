            <h1>Reflection on Solar Boost</h1>
            <section id="summary">
                <h2>Summary of the Experience</h2>
                <p>As part of my coursework, I worked on Solar Boost, a project focused on designing and developing a solar-powered portable charging station capable of charging multiple devices simultaneously. My team and I aimed to create a marketable, mobile, and heat-resistant solution for sustainable energy access.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project, we analyzed materials, heat concerns, usability, security, and marketing strategies to enhance the product’s feasibility. One of my key contributions was handling much of the documentation and communication for the team, ensuring that our work was well-organized and clearly presented. Additionally, we explored ways to improve the portability, durability, and efficiency of the charging station, considering factors such as solar panel selection, battery capacity, and enclosure materials to optimize performance.</p>
                <p>A major insight from this experience was the challenge of balancing functionality and commercial viability. Through discussions with our community partner, George Muhn, who envisions turning this into a business, I gained a deeper understanding of how engineering solutions transition from concept to marketable products.</p>

                <h2>Connection to My GCSP Theme</h2>
                <p>My GCSP theme centers around sustainable energy and space transportation. The Solar Boost project directly relates to this theme by exploring the role of renewable energy solutions in improving accessibility and mobility, a crucial aspect of sustainable infrastructure.</p>
                <p>While this project focused on portable charging solutions, the principles of energy efficiency, materials selection, and heat management are highly relevant to the development of space-based power systems. Understanding the constraints of solar energy conversion and storage in a real-world application provided valuable insights into the broader challenges of designing scalable and resilient power solutions—a critical aspect of space exploration and transportation.</p>

                <h2>Value to My GCSP Work and Career Goals</h2>
                <p>The Solar Boost project has been instrumental in reinforcing my interest in renewable energy applications and engineering entrepreneurship. It provided hands-on experience in prototype development, team collaboration, and product-market fit analysis, all of which are essential skills for my future goals.</p>
                <p>As someone interested in space transportation and sustainable energy infrastructure, this project gave me direct experience with solar energy applications, material selection, and heat management, all of which are transferable to space-based power systems, orbital refueling stations, and lunar/Mars surface infrastructure. Additionally, working with a community partner who aims to commercialize the product gave me insight into the intersection of engineering and business, aligning with my minor in Technological Entrepreneurship and Management.</p>
                <p>This experience has also informed my approach to other projects, including my personal project management app, Ordorus, by highlighting the importance of clear documentation, efficient team coordination, and iterative design improvements—all of which contribute to successful engineering solutions.</p>
